A repository dedicated for scripts made to shave off a few characters or lop off a few seconds.

## [restart_explorer.bat](restart_explorer.bat)
Restart Windows Explorer easily, useful when it freezes because I hovered over the `File>Open With` option for too long, or when it freezes because I tried to load too many thumbnails, or when it freezes for NO apparent reason... you get the point.

Usage: `C:\...> restart_explorer`

## [gitgradlec.bat](gitgradlec.bat)
Easily clone a git repo and build it using gradle. This also opens the build folder for quick access to jars. In case it wasn't obvious (which it probably wasn't), this is *made* for Minecraft modding, but should work with any gradle project.

Usage: `C:\...> gitgradlec <git repo link>`\
Ex. : `C:\...> gitgradlec https://github.com/FabricMC/fabric`

## [gradlec.bat](gradlec.bat)
Easily build a gradle project, assuming you're at the project root already. This also opens the build folder for quick access to jars. In case it wasn't obvious (which it probably wasn't), this is *made* for Minecraft modding, but should work with any gradle project.

Usage: `C:\...> gradlec`
